DESCRIPTION
    Ever given a Slide Show and needed to switch over to Vim?

    Now you don't ever have to switch again. You're already there.

    Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
    style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your slides
    don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned into a set
    of files that begin with '0', like '03' or '07c' or '05b.pl'.

    The slides are named in alphabetic order. That means you can bring them
    all into a Vim session with the command: "vim 0*". "vroom vroom" does
    exactly that.

    You can do things like advance to the next slide with the spacebar.
    Vroom creates a file called "./.vimrc" with helpful key mappings for
    navigating a slideshow. See "KEY MAPPINGS" below.

    Vroom takes advantage of Vim's syntax highlighting. It also lets you run
    slides that contain code.

    Since Vim is an editor, you can change your slides during the show.

COMMAND USAGE
    Vroom has a few command line options:

    vroom new
        Write an example "slides.vroom" file. This example contains all the
        config options and also examples of all the Vroom syntax features.

    vroom vroom
        Compile (create) the slides files from the input file and start vim
        show.

    vroom compile
        Just compile the slides.

    vroom html
        Publish the slides to HTML, with embedded JavaScript to navigate
        with the spacebar and backspace keys. Created in the "html/"
        subdirectory.

    vroom text
        Publish the slides to plain text. This action uses all the text
        slides in their unsplit form. Created in the "text/" subdirectory.

    vroom clean
        Clean up all the compiled output files.

    vroom ghpublish
        Creates a shell script in the current directory, that is intended to
        publish your slides to the special GitHub branch called gh-pages.
        See "GITHUB NOTES" below.

        This command does NOT run the script. It merely creates it for you.
        It is up to you to review the script and run it (if it makes sense
        on your system).

    vroom <action> --skip=#
        The skip option takes a number as its input and skips that number of
        files during compilation. This is useful when you are polishing your
        slides and are finished with the first 50. You can say:

            vroom vroom --skip=50

        and it will start on slide #51.

    vroom <action> --input=<file_name>
        This option lets you specify an alternate input file name, instead
        of the default one, "slides.vroom".

INPUT FORMAT
    Here is an example slides.vroom file:

        ---- config
        # These are YAML settings for Vroom
        title: My Spiffy Slideshow
        # height: 84
        # width: 20
        auto_size: 1  # Determines height/width automatically
        # skip: 12      # Skip 12 slides. Useful when making slides.
        ---- center
        My Presentation

        by Ingy
        ----
        == Stuff I care about:

        * Foo
        +* Bar
        +* Baz
        ---- perl,i10
        # Perl code indented 10 spaces
        use Vroom;

        print "Hello World";
        ---- center
        THE END

    A line that starts with '==' is a header line. It will be centered.

    Lines that begin with a '+' cause vroom to split the slide there,
    causing an animation effect.

    Lines that begin with a '%' are slide titles. Titles are completely
    optional. They are used with notes files, and also for the index page if
    you convert to HTML. You can have only one of these per slide.

    A line consisting of nothing but '====' indicates that what follows are
    notes for this slide. Notes are also optional. They are primarily used
    for notes files, but are also included if you convert your presentation
    to HTML. See "SLIDE NOTES" below.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
    Each slide can have one or more configuration options. Options are a
    comma separated list that follow the '----' header for a slide. Like
    this:

        ---- config
        ---- center
        ---- perl,i20
        ---- include file-name
        ---- replace
        ---- skip

    config
        The slide is really a yaml configuration. It will not be displayed
        in the presentation, but will tell vroom what to do from that point
        forward.

        Usually, a "config" slide is the first thing in your input file, but
        you can use more than one config slide.

    center
        Center the contents of the slide.

    i## 'i' followed by a number means to indent the contents by the number
        of characters.

    i-##
        'i' followed by a negative number means to strip that number of
        leading characters from the contents of the slide. This can be
        useful if you need to have characters special to Vroom at the
        beginning of your lines, for example if the contents of your slide
        is unified diff output.

    perl,ruby,python,php,javascript,haskell,actionscript,html,yaml,xml,json,
    make,shell,diff
        Specifies that the slide is one of those syntaxen, and that the
        appropriate file extension will be used, thus causing vim to syntax
        highlight the slide.

    include file-path-name
        Replace the line with the contents of the specified file. Useful to
        include long files that would make your slides file unruly.

    replace
        With the "replace" option, the '+' animations in the slide cause the
        content to replace the previous partial slide, rather than append to
        it.

    skip
        Ignore the following slide completely.

  CONFIG SLIDE OPTIONS
    You can specify the following configuration options in a config slide:

    title: <text>
        The title of your presentation.

    height: <number>
        The number of lines in the terminal you plan to use when presenting
        the show. Used for centering the content.

    width: <number>
        The number of columns in the terminal you plan to use when
        presenting the show. Used for centering the content.

    auto_size: <0|1>
        When set to 1, the height/width options above will be ignored and
        determined each time you start the slideshow.

    indent: <number>
        All slides will be indented by this number of spaces by default.

    list_indent: <number>
        Auto detect slides that have lists in them, and indent them by the
        specified number of columns.

    vim: <name>
        You can specify the name of the vim executable to use. If you set
        this to "gvim" special gvim support will be provided.

    GVim options
        The following options are available, if your vim option is set to
        gvim.

            fuopt: maxhorz,maxvert
            guioptions: egmLtT
            guicursor: a:blinkon0-ver25-Cursor
            guifont: Bitstream_Vera_Sans_Mono:h18

        These are all documented by gvim's help system. Please see that for
        more information.

SLIDE NOTES
    You can add notes to each slide, if you like. When you create your
    presentation (with "vroom compile" or "vroom vroom"), a file called
    "notes.txt" will be created containing all your notes, along with
    indications of when to proceed to the next slide. If you give any of
    your slides titles, they will also be put into the notes file in order
    to help you keep track of where you are in the presentation.

    You can print out your notes file, or simply bring it up on a separate
    device (such as your smartphone). The notes are not part of the
    presentation; they are just for you.

    However, if you convert your presentation to HTML, the notes will be
    included in a smaller font below each slide. This is useful when sharing
    your slides with others who were not present at the presentation.

KEY MAPPINGS
    These are the standard key mappings specified in the local ".vimrc".

    <SPACE>
        Advance one slide.

    <BACKSPACE>
        Go back one slide.

    ??  Bring up the help screen.

    RR (or R -- deprecated)
        If the current slide is declared Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Haskell or
        JavaScript, then run it accordingly.

    QQ  Quit Vroom.

    VV  Since these vim options apply while editing the "slides.vroom" file
        (yes, beware), you can use this shortcut to launch Vroom on the
        current contents whilst writing your slides.

    EE  Edit the file that the cursor is on the filename of.

        You can put file path names in your slides, and then easily bring
        them up during your presentation.

    OO  On a Mac, run the OS X "open" command on the argument that your
        cursor is on.

        For instance, if you want to display an image, you could put the
        file path of the image in your slide, then use OO to launch it.

CUSTOM CONFIGURATION
    You can create a file called ".vroom/vimrc" in your home directory. If
    vroom sees this file, it will append it onto every local ".vimrc" file
    it creates.

    Use this file to specify your own custom vim settings for all your vroom
    presentations.

    You can also create a file called ".vroom/gvimrc" for gvim overrides, if
    you are using gvim.

USING MacVim OR gvim
    If you have a Mac, you really should try using MacVim for Vroom slide
    shows. You can run it in fullscreen mode, and it looks kinda
    professional.

    To do this, set the vim option in your config section:

        vim: gvim

    NOTE: On my Mac, I have gvim symlinked to mvim, which is a smart startup
    script that ships with MacVim. Ping me, if you have questions about this
    setup.

GITHUB NOTES
    I(ngy) put all my public talks on github. I think it is an excellent way
    to publish your slides and give people a url to review them. Here are
    the things I do to make this work well:

    1) I create a repository for every presentation I give. The name of the
    repo is of the form <topic>-<event/time>-talk. You can go to
    <http://github.com/ingydotnet/> and look for the repos ending with
    "-talk".

    2) GitHub has a feature called gh-pages that you can use to create a
    website for each github repo. I use this feature to publish the html
    output of my talk. I do something like this:

        vroom html
        mv html /tmp
        git branch gh-pages
        git checkout gh-pages
        rm -r *.html
        mv /tmp/html/* .
        rmdir /tmp/html
        git add .
        git commit -m 'Publish my slides'
        git push origin gh-pages
        git checkout master

    2B) Vroom comes with a "ghpublish" option. If you run:

        > vroom ghpublish

    it will generate a script called "ghpublish" that contains commands like
    the ones above, to publish your slides to a gh-pages branch.

    3) If my repo is called "vroom-yapcna2009-talk", then after I publish
    the talk to the gh-pages branch, it will be available as
    <http://ingydotnet.github.com/vroom-yapcna2009-talk>. I then link this
    url from <http://github.com/ingydotnet/vroom-yapcna2009-talk> as the
    Homepage url.

    You can see an example of a talk published to HTML and posted via
    gh-pages at <http://ingydotnet.github.com/vroom-pm/>.
