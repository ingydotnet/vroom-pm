NAME
    Vroom::Vroom - Slide Shows in Vim

SYNOPSIS
        > mkdir MySlides    # Make a Directory for Your Slides
        > cd MySlides       # Go In There
        > vim slides.vroom  # Write Some Slides
        > vroom --vroom     # Show Your Slides

DESCRIPTION
    Ever given a Slide Show and needed to switch over to the shell?

    Now you don't ever have to switch again. You're already there.

    Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
    style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your slides
    don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned into a set
    of files that begin with '0', like '03' or '07c' or '05b.pl'.

    The slides are named in alpha order. That means you can bring them all
    into a Vim session with the command: "vim 0*". "vroom --vroom" does
    exactly that.

    Vroom creates a file called "./.vimrc" with helpful key mappings for
    navigating a slideshow. See "KEY MAPPINGS" below.

    Please note that you will need the following line in your "$HOME/.vimrc"
    file in order to pick up the local ".vimrc" file.

        set exrc

    Vroom takes advantage of Vim's syntax highlighting. It also lets you run
    slides that contain code.

    Since Vim is an editor, you can change your slides during the show.

COMMAND USAGE
    Vroom has a few command line options:

    vroom
        Just running vroom will compiles 'slides.vroom' into slide files.

    vroom --vroom
        Compile and start vim show.

    vroom --clean
        Clean up all the compiled output files.

INPUT FORMAT
    Here is an example slides.vroom file:

        ---- config
        # These are YAML settings for Vroom
        title: My Spiffy Slideshow
        height: 84
        width: 20
        # skip: 12      # Skip 12 slides. Useful when making slides.
        ---- center
        My Presentation

        by Ingy
        ----
        == Stuff I care about:

        * Foo
        +* Bar
        +* Baz
        ---- perl,i10
        # Perl code indented 10 spaces
        use Vroom::Vroom;

        print "Hello World";
        ---- center
        THE END

    A line that starts with '==' is a header line. It will be centered.

    Lines that begin with a '+' cause vroom to split the slide there,
    causing an animation effect.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
    Each slide can have one or more configuration options. Options are a
    comma separated list that follow the '----' header for a slide. Like
    this:

        ---- center
        ---- html
        ---- perl,i20
        ---- config
        ---- skip

    skip
        Ignore the following slide completely.

    center
        Center the contents of the slide.

    i## 'i' followed by a number means to indent the contents by the number
        of characters.

    perl,ruby,python,js,yaml,make,html
        Specifies that the slide is one of those syntaxen, and that the
        appropriate file extension will be used, thus causing vim to syntax
        highlight the slide.

    config
        The slide is really a yaml configuration. It will not be displayed
        in the presentation, but will tell vroom what to do from that point
        forward. You can use more than one config slide in your
        "slides.vroom" file.

    You can specify the following confguration options in a config slide:

    title <text>
        The title of your presentation.

    height <number>
        The number of lines in the terminal you plan to use when presenting
        the show. Used for centering the content.

    width <number>
        The number of columns in the terminal you plan to use when
        presenting the show. Used for centering the content.

    list_indent <number>
        Auto detect slides that have lists in them, and indent them by the
        specified number of columns.

KEY MAPPINGS
    These are the standard key mappings specified in the local ".vimrc".

    <SPACE>
        Advance one slide.

    <BACKSPACE>
        Go back one slide.

    <R> Run current slide as Perl.

    <Q> Quit Vroom.

CUSTOM CONFIGURATION
    You can create a file called ".vroom/vimrc" in your home directory. If
    vroom sees this file, it will append it onto every local ".vimrc" file
    it creates.

    Use this file to specify your own custom vim settings for all your vroom
    presentations.

NOTE
    Vroom is called Vroom but the module is Vroom::Vroom because the CPAN
    shell sometimes thinks Vroom is Tim Vroom, and it refuses to install
    him.

    Use a shell command like this to install Vroom:

        sudo cpan Vroom::Vroom
